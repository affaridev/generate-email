# Install bash
## Lets see if bash is installed.  Type this into your Terminal app.  If it shows you a version in the output, then you have bash installed.
```
echo $BASH_VERSION
```

## If bash isn't installed, you should be able to install it with brew.  But you'll need to first install brew.  Here are the details on that, if this 1 command doesn't work.
https://brew.sh
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install bash
```
brew install bash
```
